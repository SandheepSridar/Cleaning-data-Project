# CodeBook

This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

## The data source - originally intended for coursera project

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


## Transformation guide

1. Creates one final clean data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Implementation 

* Requires ```reshapre2``` and ```data.table``` libraries.
* Load both test and train data
* Load the features and activity labels.
* Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
* Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.
* Merge data set.
